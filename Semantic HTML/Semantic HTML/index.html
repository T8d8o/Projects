        <p> A decade ago, smartphones (as we know them by todays standards)
          didnt exist. Three decades earlier, no one even owned a computer.
          Think about thatthe first personal computers arrived about 40 years
          ago. Today, it seems nearly everyone is gazing at a glowing, handheld
          computer. (In fact, two-thirds of Americans own one, according to a
          Pew Report.) Intuitively, it feels like technology is progressing
          faster than ever. But is it really? According to Ray Kurzweilyes, it
          absolutely is. In his book The Singularity Is Near, Kurzweil shows
          technologys quickening pace and explains the force behind it all.
          Since the day the Eniac has been invented, we have been advancing
          exponentially in all tech fields. </p>
