        <p class="blurb">The Caribbean is a region of the Americas that consists
          of the Caribbean Sea, its islands and the surrounding coasts. The
          region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American
          mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.</p>
        <p class="blurb">The climate of the area is tropical, varying from
          tropical rainforest in some areas to tropical monsoon and tropical
          savanna in others. There are also some locations that are arid
          climates with considerable drought in some years, and the peaks of
          mountains tend to have cooler temperate climates.</p>
